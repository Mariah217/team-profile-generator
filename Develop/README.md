## Installation

To begin using this application, you must install Node.js onto your computer. Then you will need to do a git clone to get the repo so you have a copy of the Team Profile Generator. Next, you will need to use your terminal to install the following libraries; inquirer and fs. To do so, type npm install and the name of the library (example: npm install inquirer). Once you have everything installed, you will enter node index.js into your terminal and answer the prompted questions.
