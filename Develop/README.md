# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This Team Profile Generator allows you to answer command-line prompts regarding employees and generate a website displaying all the team members and their information. The team members include: manager, engineers and interns. Each card that populates holds information for each employee such as; name, ID, e-mail, office number, GitHub username and school. This application makes it easy to keep track of all your employees and their information. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

To begin using this application, you must install Node.js onto your computer. Then you will need to do a git clone to get the repo so you have a copy of the Team Profile Generator. Next, you will need to use your terminal to install the following libraries; inquirer and fs. To do so, type npm install and the name of the library (example: npm install inquirer). Once you have everything installed, you will enter node index.js into your terminal and answer the prompted questions. Once all of the questions have been answered, your Team Profile Generator will be generated for you as team.html.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I take credit for my code. I used Bootstrap for my cards, I used Google Fonts for all the font on my website and I used Font Awesome for the icons.
